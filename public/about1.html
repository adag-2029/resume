<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Annwesha Das from India, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you. Currently venturing into the realm of web development with my first project in VS Code, I am crafting an online resume that reflects my passion for technology and creativity. My educational voyage began at Northpoint senior secondary boarding school, providing me with a solid foundation. Presently, I am immersed in the world of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at UEM, where I continue to expand my knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>This web project serves as a testament to my dedication and growth. I'm eager to showcase not just my academic achievements but also my experiences and proficiency in various technologies. As I navigate this exciting chapter, I welcome you to explore my online resume and feel free to connect with me. Your feedback is invaluable as I strive to make this digital representation a true reflection of my capabilities.</p>
